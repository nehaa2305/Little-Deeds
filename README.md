# Little-Deeds
Users are prompted to complete daily and weekly tasks to garner points and compete with friends.

## Inspiration
We wanted to create a platform through which people will feel encouraged to complete good deeds.

## What it does
Users can complete a daily task and 3 weekly tasks. The tasks are the same for all users. Completing each task rewards the user some points. The user can also gain extra points if someone submits a Google Form with a picture and comments about the task or about the user. Users can compete with their friends for points and all users within the group are prompted to do a good deed that benefits the previous week's winner. The groups can also compete with other groups.

## How we built it
We initially created the framework for the website through Figma and then set up the website through Velo using WiX. 

## Challenges we ran into
We changed our layout numerous times. We initially decided to have two pages in our layout. However, we found that the pages felt too congested and full. We eventually decided on 6 pages. Implementing different features also proved difficult due to us coding on Velo for the first time.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Our login features as well as the layout for the website took a while to figure out. We are also proud of our whole design of everything.

## What we learned
We learned how to code JavaScript through Velo and how to link different functions to different components of the website.

## What's next for Little Deeds
Little Deeds could expand to allow groups to compete with other local groups. We could also construct some other way to verify if the user has completed a task or offer different rewards through the point system.
